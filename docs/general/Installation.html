		<h1>Installation</h1>
		<h2>General requirements</h2>
		<p>
			The server-side implementation can be installed on any web server that supports PHP, version 7.4 or later, and common Apache HTTP functionality. Please note the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The eventsource resource requires that output buffering is turned off. In most server configurations this can be achieved with the directive "php_value output_buffering off" in a <span class="name">.htaccess</span> file.
			</li>
			<li>
				Each eventsource session occupies one entry process. This is usually a limited resource in shared web hosting environments.
			</li>
			<li>
				The clientId generator requires that the PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.gmp.php">GMP library</a> is enabled.
			</li>
			<li>The PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php">socket extension</a> must be enabled.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>File locations</h2>
		<p>
			The items in the <span class="name">public</span> directory must be made publicly accessible, typically by placing them inside the <span class="name">public_html</span> folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			The items in the <span class="name">private</span> directory can be saved anywhere on the server as long as they can be accessed by the public PHP scripts. Directories for logging, sockets, and data require write access.
		</p>
		
		<h2>PHP constants</h2>
		<p>
			CRSocket server resources require several PHP constants. In the default implementation these are generated by
			<span class="name">boot.php</span> scripts. If the directory structure is kept unchanged, the only constant that needs to be adapted is <span class="name">CRSOCKET_ROOT</span> in the top level boot script. This constant must contain the path to the private directory.
		</p>
		<h2>Identifiers</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt id="app_id">APP_ID</dt>
			<dd>
				Identifies a controller/responder pair. In the default implemtation, this is deduced from the basename of the directory where the resources related to the pair are located. This is used to ensure communication integrity and must correspond with the id transmitted by the client apps.
			</dd>
			
			<dt id="resource_name">RESOURCE_NAME</dt>
			<dd>
				The server resource that initiated the script, In the default implementation, this is deduced from the basename of the directory where the script is located. This id is used to create individual log files for each resource.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h2>Source code directories</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt id="crsocket_php">CRSOCKET_PHP</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains shared CRSocket PHP scripts.
			</dd>
			
			<dt id="app_php">APP_PHP</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains app specfic PHP scripts. The MathTrials app contains two such scripts: <span class="name">MathTrialsConfig.php</span> which extends the CRConfig class with functionality related to authentication and saving, and <span class="name">MathTrial.php</span> which contains info and response data from each trial.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h2>Directories accessed by all CRSocket resources</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt id="crsocket_data">CRSOCKET_DATA</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains data files. In the default implementation this is used to save a single file named <span class="filename">prevId.bin</span> which contains the last generated clientId.
			</dd>
			
			<dt id="crsocket_log">CRSOCKET_LOG</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains log files. In the default implementation this is used to save files named <span class="filename">[clientId].log</span> contaning serialised crEvents transmitted by the corresponding clients where the logged attribute was set to true.
			</dd>
			
			<dt id="crsocket_sock">CRSOCKET_SOCK</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains socket resources. This directory contains Unix sockets named <span class="filename">[clientId].sock</span> are used to transmit events between sendevent and eventsource scripts.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<h2>Directories accessed by app-specific resources</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt id="app_log">APP_LOG</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains logs generated by app resources. There will be one log for each resource, eg. <span class="filename">sendevent.log</span> and <span class="name">eventsource.log</span>.
			</dd>
			
			<dt id="app_data">APP_DATA</dt>
			<dd>
				Path to the directory that contains data collected by app resources. In the MathTrials app this directory is used to save trial results in a file named <span class="name">results.csv</span>.
			</dd>
		</dl>
