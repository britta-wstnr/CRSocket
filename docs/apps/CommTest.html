		<h1>CommTest</h1>
		<p>
			This application facilitates testing of the CRSocket component, using default settings. It consists of a controller/responder app pair that are identical, except that they are initiated with "controller" and "responder"
			<a href="../general/Terminology.html#clientRole">clientRoles</a> respectively.
		</p>
		
		<p>Note that the <a href="../general/Terminology.html#accessToken">accessToken</a> must be a non-empty string of Ascii printable characters.</p>
		
		<h2>Functionality</h2>
		<p>The primary purpose of the app is to monitor:</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="serverComm">
				Number of events transmitted between eventreceiver resources and requesting clients.
			</li>
			
			<li id="socketComm">
				Number of events transmitted between <a href="../general/Terminology.html#crSocket">CRSocket</a> objects.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Current state and subState of the CRSocket object, and its internal CREventReceiver and CREventSender objects.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Success rate, delays and reception accuracy of
				<a href="../general/Terminology.html#crEvent">crEvents</a> transmitted between
				<a href="../general/Terminology.html#CRSocket_client">CRSocket clients</a>.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Handling of various types of errors and exceptions. This includes the pairing procedure.
				<a href="../general/Terminology.html#partnerClientId">partnerClientId</a> assignment can only be done by the controller app.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For multiple events use event type "multi" and specify number of events, and min/max secs between events. The parameters will be set to the current event number and the current delay to the next event in millisecs.
			For single events you may optionally specify subType and two event parameters. In both cases it is possible to toggle the log, buffered and interceptable event flags.
		</p>

		<p>The app displays:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Number of messageEvents transmitted to/from the <a href="../resources/eventsource.html">eventsource</a> server resource.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Amount of time <a href="../js/CREventReceiver.html">CREventReceiver</a> objects spends in connecting, open and closed states.
			</li>
			
			<li>The round trip time of <a href="../resources/eventsource.html#aliveEvent">alive</a> messsageEvents.</li>
			
			<li>No of crEvents transmitted to/from partner clients.</li>
			
			<li>
				The current state/substate of the crSocket, and it's internal <a href="../js/CREventReceiver.html">CREventReceiver</a> and
				<a href="../js/CREventSender.html">CREventSender</a> objects.
			</li>
			<li>Conficuration parameters assigned to the crSocket: clientId, accessToken and partnerClientId.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>It is also possible to monitor state changes and internal events in the browser JavaScript console.</p>
