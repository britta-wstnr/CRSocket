		<h1>MathTrials</h1>
		<p>
			This application illustrates how the CRSocket component can be used to implement remotely controlled digital task web apps. It also illustrates how server-side plugins can be used to implement authentication and storage functionality. The typical use scenario is to use a phone as controller and a tablet as responder, but the app pair can also be tested in ordinary browsers.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Functionality</h2>
		<p>The primary functionality includes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Signing in with a user id.</li>
			<li>Identifying and connecting to a responder app.</li>
			<li>Saving and automatically reapplying authentication and pairing info on controller and responder apps.</li>
			<li>Monitoring of connection states and other issues.</li>
			<li>Administration of tasks, consisting of random mathematical challenges</li>
			<li>Monitoring of response accuracy, average response time, and data saving.</li>
			<li>Downloading results.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Usage</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To sign in, enter "alice" or "bob" in the User field</li>
			<li>Both controller and responder apps must be signed in with the same user.</li>
			<li>
				To pair with a responder, the clientId shown in the responder app (6 digits) must be entered in the Responder field in the controller app.
			</li>
			<li>The responder app will only accept connection if it is not already assigned to another controller.</li>
			<li>
				When a responder app has been successfully paired and is interacting with a controller, the connection dialogue will be hidden.
			</li>
			<li>The Participant field must contain 3 or more alphanumeric characters.</li>
			<li>
				When a participant id has been assigned, it is possible to run simple tasks consisting of three trials with random math challenges.
			</li>
			<li>
				Active tasks on the responder will always continue to the end, regardless of connection issues, unless actively cancelled by the controller app.
			</li>
			<li>Data recorded for the current combination of user and participant id can be downloaded by pressing the Download button.</li>
		</ul>
